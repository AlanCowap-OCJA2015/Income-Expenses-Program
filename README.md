# Income-Expenses-Program
A program to allow a user to track a family's income and expenses.

• You can use Eclipse! Just don't start forgetting about all that command line stuff we covered :)
• You are required to design an application that a client has requested, the spec will be provided and attached to this e-mail. 
• You must have a schedule and plan set out before you start coding which you will present as part of your technical presentation, keep track of how you were doing compared to your schedule and explain what you felt made you go a little off time.
• You must assign roles within the team, have designated roles and a clear idea of what each person must be doing the entire way through the program, when presenting your presentation cover all the roles and such in that also.
• You must have a demo working for the client to view and use.
• You must have a technical presentation created to explain the techniques and technologies that you used with explanations as to why you chose that way of completing the task over another possible option.
• The code must be appropriately commented and tabbed to aid readability along with correct naming conventions followed for all variables declared.
• Everyone in the team must contribute. (be inclusive not exclusive!)
• You will gain kudos points for assisting other teams with their program so ensure you keep track of who you helped, and what you helped with.
• You must come up with a cool company name to name your team :D
• All of the base requirements must be met and fulfilled correctly, optional requirements that you met will be ignored if the base requirements are not met.
• If you find yourself finished or think of a feature that can be added to your program, try and implement it and include in your presentation why you felt that feature would improve the program and make it better for the user.

The teams are listed below, the deadline for everything to be completed is Friday morning. Where you will present your demo and technical presentations to the entire class.

The design for the GUI is entirely up to you as programmers to decide upon, but always think about how the user will interact with it and ensure it has a minimalistic and simple to use design, don't want to overwhelm the user with too much on screen.
